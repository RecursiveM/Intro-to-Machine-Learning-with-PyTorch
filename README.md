# Intro-to-Machine-Learning-with-PyTorch
This repository contains three projects of Uacity's NanoDegree Intro to Machine Learning with PyTorch


## Finding-Donors: 
This project is designed to get me acquainted with the many supervised learning algorithms available in sklearn, and to also provide for a method of evaluating just how each model works and performs on a certain type of data. It is important in machine learning to understand exactly when and where a certain algorithm should be used, and when one should be avoided.

`about dataset`: CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. After nearly 32,000 letters were sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. With nearly 15 million working Californians, CharityML has brought you on board to help build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail. Your goal will be evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.



## CIFAR-10_Image_Classifier-STARTER: 
In this project, I'll demonstrate the skills I’ve developed in this course by building an image classifier and object detection system using PyTorch. To do this project, I'll need to pull together the new deep learning skills I've just learned, such as data augmentation and building neural networks in order to solve the problem presented in the scenario below.


Using the skills i’ve acquired building neural networks using PyTorch, my task was to build an image classifier using the CIFAR-10 dataset and evaluate its accuracy. Then i'll compare its performance to both Detectocorp’s algorithm (which achieved 70% accuracy) as well as the state of the art results detailed in the notebook—and make a recommendation to management about whether to build the solution in-house or buy the algorithm from Detectocorp.

`I achieved 76% accuracy`




## Identify_Customer_Segments:
In this project, i worked with real-life data provided to me by our Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. The data here concerns a company that performs mail-order sales in Germany. Their main question of interest is to identify facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign. My job as a data scientist will be to use unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company. Prior to applying the machine learning methods, you will also need to assess and clean the data in order to convert the data into a usable form. In addition, the dataset presented in this project requires a number of assessment and cleaning steps before you can apply your machine learning methods. In workplace contexts, you will frequently need to work with data that is untidy or needs preprocessing before standard algorithms and models can be applied. The ability to perform data wrangling and the ability to make decisions on data that you work with are both valuable skills that you will practice in this project.
